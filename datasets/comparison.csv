**TIME:** 2026-02-11 20:33 to 20:46 UTC (13 minutes)

**ONE-LINER:** Elevated span sampling and inbound network traffic on **trace-spans-meta-extractor** in **us1.prod.dog** datacenter for org 46426.

**DETAILS:**
- **Primary issue:** Span sampling rate spiked on `trace-spans-meta-extractor` service (org 46426), indicating potential increase in trace volume or sampling configuration change
- **Secondary impact:** Network ingress traffic anomaly on same service correlates with span volume spike, affecting **spans-openai** cluster infrastructure
- **Notable context:** Anomalies are tightly clustered across multiple metrics (13-minute window), suggesting a single root cause affecting both application-layer span processing and network I/O

---

**Key Findings:**
- Both widgets show anomalies in the same 13-minute window, indicating coordinated behavior
- The correlation between span metrics and network traffic suggests the issue stems from processing load rather than isolated network problems
- Single organization (org 46426) and service (**trace-spans-meta-extractor**) affected, making this scoped and potentially actionable | Based on the anomaly data provided, here's the structured summary:

---

**TIME:** 20:33 to 20:46 UTC (13 minutes)

**ONE-LINER:** Span processing volume and inbound traffic surge on **trace-spans-meta-extractor** in **us1.prod.dog**.

**DETAILS:**
- **Span sampling rate spike** for org_id:46426 indicating potential intake volume increase
- **Network inbound traffic elevated** across **spans-openai cluster**, affecting data ingestion capacity
- Anomalies simultaneous across metrics suggests correlated backend processing surge

---

**Key Observations:**

1. **Two correlated anomalies** - Both metrics show overlapping anomalous windows, with network traffic extending slightly longer (full 13 min vs 12 min for spans)
2. **Scope convergence** - All three associated services (trace-sublayer-extractor, trace-stats-extractor, trace-spans-meta-extractor) affected through **trace-spans-meta-extractor** as the central processing point
3. **Infrastructure impact** - The network traffic anomaly on the **spans-openai** cluster suggests either increased upstream data volume or a processing bottleneck causing traffic accumulation

**Why it matters:** Sustained elevated span ingestion and network traffic in a 13-minute window could indicate an upstream service spike, scaling issue, or data quality problem affecting the entire trace processing pipeline."

## SUMMARY OF DATADOG DASHBOARD ANOMALIES

**TIME:** 20:31:20 to 20:52:00 UTC (approximately 21 minutes)

**ONE-LINER:** Kafka lag spikes across **rum-joky slowlane**, **trace-dusk normal lanes**, and **spans-bond slowlane** clusters with cascading log processing anomalies in **logs-rule-mapper**

**SUMMARY:** Multiple Kafka lag metrics spiked across different traffic lanes and clusters over a 21-minute window, with concurrent anomalies in log matching and production rates in the rule mapper service, suggesting potential consumer group processing issues or downstream backpressure.

**DETAILS:**

- **Kafka lag escalation:** Offset lag spike on **kafka-struct-rum-42b3** slowlane (20:31:20-20:31:40), followed by time lag anomalies on **kafka-struct-trace-ac7b** normal lanes (20:32:40-20:40:20) and **kafka-struct-big-31de** slowlane (20:34:00-20:41:20)—suggests cascading consumer lag across multiple clusters

- **Log processing correlation:** **logs-rule-mapper** pod (`logs-rule-mapper-trace-dusk-76cb4ccfd9-wrpdm`) and **org_id:46426** both show matching log anomalies (20:33:00 onwards) overlapping with the main lag window, indicating processing bottleneck propagation

- **Production volume impact:** **MappedLogs produced** metric anomaly (20:33:00-20:46:00) for trace-type mapped logs correlates with lag and matching anomalies—suggests the lag is causing upstream backpressure or the service is unable to drain the queue at normal rates

## SUMMARY

**TIME:** 20:31:20 to 20:52:00 UTC (21 minutes)

**ONE-LINER:** Kafka lag spike across multiple cells and clusters impacting **logs-rule-mapper** processing.

**DETAILS:**
- **kafka-struct-rum-42b3** (rum-joky cell) experienced offset lag spike (20s); **kafka-struct-trace-ac7b** (trace-dusk cell) saw time lag elevation for 7.7 minutes; **kafka-struct-big-31de** (spans-bond cell) had sustained lag for 7.3 minutes
- Log matching and output production anomalies for org_id:**46426** persisted for 19 minutes (20:33-20:52), with isolated spike in dropped messages (invalid_consumer reason)
- Pattern indicates cascading backpressure across multiple Kafka topics affecting both normal and slowlane traffic lanes

---

## KEY FINDINGS

**Affected Services:** logs-rule-mapper, eventplatform-worker, event-usage-mapper

**Affected Clusters/Cells:**
- **kafka-struct-rum-42b3** (rum-joky)
- **kafka-struct-trace-ac7b** (trace-dusk)
- **kafka-struct-big-31de** (spans-bond)

**Metrics Impacted:**
- Kafka streaming lag (both offset and time variants)
- Log matching counts
- MappedLogs produced count
- Dropped messages with invalid_consumer reason

**Duration:** Primary anomaly window 20:33-20:52 (19 minutes), with earlier Kafka lag indicators starting at 20:31

This represents a multi-tier processing issue where Kafka lag propagated upstream into log matching and output generation, suggesting either consumer lag, topic backpressure, or resource constraints in the rule mapper service. | I'll analyze these anomalies and create a structured summary following your format.

Let me break down the key findings:

**Timeline Analysis:**
- Overall window: 20 minutes (20:31:20 - 20:52:00)
- Widget anomalies clustered in two phases: initial spike (20:31-20:32), then sustained elevation (20:33-20:52)

**Scope Indicators:**
- Services: **logs-rule-mapper**, **eventplatform-worker**, **event-usage-mapper**
- Infrastructure: **kafka-struct-rum-42b3**, **kafka-struct-trace-ac7b**, **kafka-struct-big-31de**, **trace-dusk**, **spans-bond**, **rum-joky**
- Pod: **logs-rule-mapper-trace-dusk-76cb4ccfd9-wrpdm**
- Datacenter: **us1.prod.dog**
- Organization: **org_id:46426**

**Pattern Recognition:**
All anomalies center on Kafka lag metrics (offset and time lag) across multiple clusters and slowlane traffic, with secondary impacts on matching logs and message throughput.

## SUMMARY

**TIME:** 20:31 - 20:52 UTC (21 minutes)

**ONE-LINER:** Elevated Kafka lag across **rule-mapper** pipeline with slowlane traffic bottleneck on **trace-dusk** and **rum-joky** clusters.

**DETAILS:**
- Time lag spiked on **trace-dusk** (non-slowlane) and **spans-bond** (slowlane) clusters, peak ~8 minutes each
- Matching logs from **org_id:46426** and **logs-rule-mapper** pod remained elevated for full window (19 minutes sustained)

## FORMATTED ANOMALY SUMMARY

**TIME:** 15:00 to 15:10 UTC (10 minutes)

**ONE-LINER:** **code-annotation-generator** providers (**test_optimization**, **iac**) showing anomalous success rates across multiple organizations

**SUMMARY:** Code annotation generation experienced elevated counts for successful results across two distinct provider types targeting different organizational contexts, suggesting potential throughput or processing pattern changes during this 10-minute window.

**DETAILS:**
- **test_optimization** provider anomaly sustained across full 10-minute window in **org_id:295742** with successful results metric spike
- **iac** provider showed brief anomalous spike in **org_id:135441** concurrent with test_optimization timeframe, indicating potential shared infrastructure issue
- Both anomalies filtered on `status:success` with `has_results:true`, suggesting annotation generation is completing but with anomalous result counts

---

## KEY INSIGHTS

- **Affected Services:** code-annotation-generator (primary concern)
- **Pattern Type:** Count/throughput anomaly on successful operations
- **Scope:** Cross-organization impact (2 distinct org IDs), multiple provider types
- **Duration:** 10-minute sustained event with instantaneous spike variant
- **Severity Context:** Both showing successful completion states, so not a failure scenario—likely a resource utilization or queue backlog issue | Based on the anomaly data provided, here's the structured summary:

---

**TIME:** 15:00 to 15:10 UTC (10 minutes)

**ONE-LINER:** Spike in successful **code-annotation-generator** results across **test optimization** and **IaC** providers

**DETAILS:**
- **Test Optimization** count anomaly sustained over full 10-minute window, org 295742
- **IaC** provider metrics spiked at 15:00, org 135441 — both with successful results (status:success, has_results:true)
- Concurrent provider anomalies suggest increased annotation generation activity across multiple org scopes

---

**Key Pattern:** Both widgets show spikes in *successful* annotation counts (not errors), indicating the code-annotation-generator service experienced elevated throughput during this window, not a degradation. The different durations (sustained vs. instantaneous) suggest test optimization processing was more prolonged while IaC analysis completed quickly. | Based on the anomaly data provided and following the structured format you specified:

---

**TIME:** 2026-02-11 15:00-15:10 UTC (10 minutes)

**ONE-LINER:** Success count anomalies across **code-annotation-generator** test optimization and IaC providers

**DETAILS:**
- **code-annotation-generator** success counts spiked across test optimization (org_id:295742) and IaC (org_id:135441) providers
- Anomalies affected results-returning calls; test optimization sustained 10-min spike, IaC spike at interval start
- Elevated provider success rates suggest unexpected surge in valid analysis results or increased provider capacity

---

**Analysis Summary:**

Two distinct anomalies were detected in the `[SCI] Code Annotation Providers` dashboard over a 10-minute window on 2026-02-11:

1. **Widget 1 (Test Optimization):** Success count spike in `dd.code_annotation_generator.providers.test_optimization.duration` for organization 295742, spanning the entire 10-minute anomalous window
2. **Widget 2 (IaC):** Success count spike in `dd.code_annotation_generator.providers.iac.duration` for organization 135441, concentrated at the anomaly start window

Both anomalies indicate elevated success rates in the **code-annotation-generator** service across different provider modules. The pattern suggests either a legitimate spike in provider activity with successful results, or a configuration/behavior shift that increased the throughput of successful provider invocations."

**TIME:** 2026-02-11T20:22:20Z (point-in-time spike)

**ONE-LINER:** **G1 Young Generation** garbage collection spike on **logs-issue-reducer** pod in **us1.prod.dog**

**SUMMARY:** Anomalous spike detected in JVM garbage collection time for the G1 young generation on a single logs-issue-reducer pod, indicating potential memory pressure or sudden allocation surge in the logs processing pipeline.

**DETAILS:**
- **logs-issue-reducer** experiencing elevated **gc.g1_young_generation.time** on pod `logs-issue-reducer-22962-datadog-sep-5f97fb697-5hrrl`
- Part of logs reduction service cluster (**logs-rum-reducer**, **logs-ci-app-reducer**, **logs-rule-reducer** ecosystem) in **us1.prod.dog** datacenter
- Single pod/instance impact suggests isolated memory event rather than cluster-wide degradation

---

**Key Observations:**
- The anomaly represents a **point-in-time event** (same start/end timestamp) rather than a sustained window
- Scoped to a **specific pod instance** within logs-issue-reducer, not the entire service
- **G1 Young Generation GC** focus indicates memory activity in younger object generation (typically short-lived objects)

**ONE-LINER:** **logs-issue-reducer** GC pause spike in **us1.prod.dog**

**DETAILS:**
- G1 Young Generation garbage collection time spiked on a single pod instance
- Single instantaneous anomaly event with no sustained duration
- Likely transient JVM memory pressure on the affected pod replica

---

**Analysis Notes:**

This is a **point-in-time anomaly** rather than a sustained issue. The anomalous time range shows the same start and end timestamp (20:22:20Z), indicating a momentary spike in GC activity rather than a prolonged degradation. The metric `sum:logs.jvm.gc.g1_young_generation.time` measures the percentage of time the JVM spent in Young Generation garbage collection on a specific pod (`logs-issue-reducer-22962-datadog-sep-5f97fb697-5hrrl`) in the US production datacenter. 

While the dashboard name references multiple reducer services (logs-rum-reducer, logs-ci-app-reducer, logs-rule-reducer), only the **logs-issue-reducer** shows the GC anomaly in the affected widget. This suggests the GC spike is isolated to one service component rather than a systemic issue across all reducer services. | Based on the project configuration and dataset provided, I'll generate a structured summary for the GC Time anomaly you've provided. Following the format and style examples in the dataset:

---

**TIME:** 20:22:20 UTC (instantaneous spike)

**ONE-LINER:** G1 Young Generation garbage collection spike on **logs-issue-reducer** pod in **us1.prod.dog**.

**DETAILS:**

- Heap memory pressure triggered GC pause on **logs-issue-reducer-22962-datadog-sep-5f97fb697-5hrrl** pod
- Affects **logs reducer cluster** (**logs-rum-reducer**, **logs-ci-app-reducer**, **logs-rule-reducer**) in production US cell
- Point-in-time GC event may indicate memory allocation surge or minor object churn impacting request latency

---

## Key Scope Indicators

- **Service:** logs-issue-reducer
- **Datacenter:** us1.prod.dog
- **Pod:** logs-issue-reducer-22962-datadog-sep-5f97fb697-5hrrl
- **Metric Type:** JVM G1 Young Generation GC time
- **Duration:** Instantaneous (single timestamp anomaly)

## Analysis

This is a **point-in-time anomaly** rather than a sustained issue. The identical start/end timestamps indicate a momentary spike in garbage collection activity on a specific pod replica. The G1 Young Generation garbage collection focus suggests elevated memory pressure on short-lived object allocations, which could stem from:

- Temporary traffic spike during log reduction processing
- Brief memory allocation surge in the logs pipeline
- Normal GC activity that exceeded alerting baseline

Since the anomaly is isolated to a single pod instance (not the entire service cluster), this suggests a localized memory event rather than a systemic issue across the logs reducer infrastructure."

## SUMMARY

**TIME:** 2026-02-11T20:31:20Z to 2026-02-11T20:52:00Z (~21 minutes)

**ONE-LINER:** Kafka lag cascade across **rule_mapper** pipeline affecting **rum-joky** and **spans-bond** clusters with downstream impact on **logs-rule-mapper** matching logs for **org_id:46426**.

**SUMMARY:** Slowlane traffic lag initiated in the RUM Kafka cluster, propagated through the rule mapper pipeline causing reduced log matching throughput, and cascaded into span processing delays across multiple organizations and pods over a 21-minute window.

**DETAILS:**
- Offset lag spike in **kafka-struct-rum-42b3** (slowlane/abuselane/overflowlane) preceded by 2+ minutes a broader matching logs anomaly affecting **org_id:46426** that persisted for 19 minutes, indicating upstream bottleneck
- Rule mapper produced fewer mapped logs (13-minute impact window) while simultaneously dropping messages with `invalid_consumer` reason, suggesting processing backpressure
- Time lag propagated to **kafka-struct-big-31de** (spans-bond cluster) affecting span processing, with the core matching logs anomaly on org_id:46426 extending 8 minutes longer than remediation of downstream metrics

- Log matching and rule processing impacted: anomalies on **logs.k9.rules.matching_logs** (org_id:46426 sustained for 19 min) and **MappedLogs produced count** showing reduced throughput; one decoder drop spike on **logs-rule-mapper** service
- Pattern indicates processing backlog/throughput reduction during the window, with most severe impact concentrated 20:33-20:46Z when multiple metrics spiked simultaneously

**DETAILS:**
- **Slowlane offset lag spiked** in **kafka-struct-rum-42b3** at start of window
- **logs-rule-mapper pod** matching volume dropped for 19 minutes across two metrics
- **Org 46426** impacted longest; pattern suggests downstream processing bottleneck

---

## Analysis

**Widget-by-widget breakdown:**

1. **Slowlane Lag (offset)** — Kicked off the anomaly window with a sharp 9-second spike in **Kafka offset lag** on the RUM slowlane topic. This suggests the **kafka-struct-rum-42b3** cluster fell behind processing.

2. **Matching logs - by pod** — ~2 minutes later, the **logs-rule-mapper-trace-dusk-76cb4ccfd9-wrpdm** pod showed a matching volume drop at 20:33Z (single second anomaly). This is likely a secondary effect from upstream Kafka lag.

3. **Matching logs - by org** — The same pod's volume dropped for **org_id:46426** and persisted for the full 19-minute window (20:33–20:52Z). This extended duration suggests either a sustained processing issue or a slow recovery for this organization's traffic.

**Pattern interpretation:** The cascade (Kafka lag → pod matching drop → org-level impact) indicates a **processing bottleneck** in the logs rule mapper system, with the **us1.prod.dog** datacenter affected."

**TIME:** 2025-11-25 09:50 UTC (instantaneous spike)

**ONE-LINER:** Event loop delay spike on **morpheus-public-dashboard-query** service

**SUMMARY:** Peak event loop delay anomaly detected on the Node.js runtime for the morpheus-public-dashboard-query service in production, indicating potential CPU contention or blocking operations.

**DETAILS:**
- **Primary Issue:** Maximum **event_loop.delay** metric exceeded baseline on **prod** environment for **morpheus-public-dashboard-query**
- **Secondary Impact:** Instantaneous duration suggests brief but acute performance degradation; potential query processing bottleneck
- **Context:** Single widget affected (Peak event loop); no correlated anomalies across multiple services indicates isolated incident

---

## Key Observations

The anomaly represents a momentary event loop delay spike at a single timestamp. This type of anomaly typically indicates:
- Synchronous blocking operation in Node.js processing
- Temporary CPU resource constraint
- High-volume query execution spike

The fact that it's isolated to one metric on one service suggests a localized issue rather than systemic infrastructure problems. The instantaneous nature (09:50 to 09:50 with no duration) may indicate either a very brief spike or data resolution at that timestamp. | Based on the anomaly data provided, here's the structured summary:

**ONE-LINER:** Event loop delay spike in **morpheus-public-dashboard-query** service

**DETAILS:**
- Peak event loop delay spiked in production environment
- Node.js runtime blocking detected; impacts query response times
- Indicates potential CPU saturation or synchronous operation blocking

---

**Analysis Notes:**

The anomaly shows a single-point spike in `max:runtime.node.event_loop.delay.max` for the **morpheus-public-dashboard-query** service in production. This metric tracks the maximum delay in Node.js's event loop—when this spikes, it indicates that JavaScript execution is blocking the event loop, preventing timely processing of I/O operations and incoming requests.

**Key implications:**
- Users querying the Morpheus Public Dashboard may experience latency
- The instantaneous nature suggests a brief but significant blocking operation occurred
- This could stem from CPU-intensive calculations, synchronous operations, or garbage collection pauses

**TIME:** 2026-02-11 20:31:20 to 20:52:00 (20 minutes 40 seconds)

**ONE-LINER:** Kafka lag spike and matching logs drop across **logs-rule-mapper** and **kafka-struct-rum-42b3** cluster in slowlane traffic.

**DETAILS:**
- **Slowlane offset lag spiked** on **rum-joky** structured topic for ~20 seconds
- **Matching logs dropped** for pod **logs-rule-mapper-trace-dusk-76cb4ccfd9-wrpdm** and **org_id:46426** (19+ minute duration)
- Slowlane backpressure may have blocked rule matching throughput across multiple tenants

---

**Key Observations:**

1. **Widget 1 (Slowlane Lag):** Brief spike in Kafka offset lag (20 seconds) on the structured slowlane topic suggests a brief processing bottleneck
2. **Widgets 2 & 3 (Matching Logs):** Sustained drop in matching logs metrics lasting 19+ minutes, affecting both a specific pod and a specific organization
3. **Pattern:** The lag spike appears to be a leading indicator of the matching logs degradation, suggesting backpressure in the rule matching pipeline affecting downstream consumers

This indicates a **rule matching processing degradation** affecting the **event-usage-mapper** and **eventplatform-worker** services in the **us1.prod.dog** datacenter."

## Summary

**TIME:** 2026-02-11 20:45-20:48 UTC (2 minutes, 20 seconds)

**ONE-LINER:** Struct-to-queryable latency spike on **routed_event_store_writer** workload in **us1.prod.dog** datacenter

**SUMMARY:** Query1 of the ""Struct to queryable < 30s"" SLO metric experienced a sharp anomaly indicating that fewer events met the <30 second latency threshold during this window, suggesting degraded storage-to-queryable conversion performance.

**DETAILS:**
- **Primary issue:** **logs.flow.topic.global_storage_latency** (≤30s bucket) dropped abnormally on trace workload in **us1.prod.dog**, directly impacting SLO compliance for the < 30s threshold
- **Affected scope:** **eventplatform-worker** and **event-platform-query-api** services handling routed event store writer operations; query1 anomaly indicates fewer fast-path completions
- **Context:** Anomaly isolated to specific workload/datacenter/track_type combination (routed_event_store_writer, us1.prod.dog, trace); suggests targeted performance degradation rather than widespread systemic issue

---

This summary highlights the key scope indicators (**services**, **datacenters**, **workloads**) and focuses on what the metric anomaly means: a latency threshold SLO experienced degraded performance during a brief 2+ minute window affecting event structuring operations. | Based on the anomaly data provided, here's the structured summary:

TIME: 2026-02-11 20:45:40Z to 20:48:00Z (2 minutes 20 seconds)

ONE-LINER: Storage latency spike on **routed_event_store_writer** in **us1.prod.dog** affecting trace ingestion.

DETAILS:
- **logs.flow.topic.global_storage_latency** exceeded 30s threshold for struct-to-queryable conversion on trace workload
- Query1 (<=30s bucket) showed anomalous behavior while query2 (unbounded) remained stable, indicating saturation at the 30s boundary
- Isolated to **us1.prod.dog** datacenter with trace track_type; no canary/shadow/low-QOS traffic involved

---

This summary indicates a latency degradation in the event platform's storage pipeline specifically affecting structured trace event processing, localized to a single production datacenter and workload. | Based on the anomaly analysis you've provided, here's the structured summary:

---

**TIME:** ~2 minutes 20 seconds (2026-02-11T20:45:40Z to 2026-02-11T20:48:00Z)

**ONE-LINER:** Struct-to-queryable latency spike on **routed_event_store_writer** in **us1.prod.dog** exceeding 30s threshold.

**DETAILS:**
- **routed_event_store_writer** workload experienced elevated storage latency beyond 30-second SLO target
- Impacts trace event ingestion pipeline in production us1 datacenter
- Anomalous increase in histogram bucket counts indicates broader latency distribution shift

---

## Key Findings

**Affected Components:**
- **Service:** eventplatform-worker (via routed_event_store_writer workload)
- **Metric:** `logs.flow.topic.global_storage_latency` (buckets.le.30)
- **Scope:** Production us1 datacenter, trace track type, non-canary/non-shadow infrastructure
- **Duration:** ~140 seconds of anomalous behavior

**What Shifted:**
The query1 metric (≤30s bucket) experienced an unexpected spike during the window, indicating that more events were taking longer than the 30-second SLO target to transition from struct format to queryable state.

**Why It Matters:**
This represents an SLO breach on the EventPlatform's struct-to-queryable pipeline, which directly impacts event ingestion latency for downstream consumers. The affected **routed_event_store_writer** workload is critical for trace event routing in production."
